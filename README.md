# Odin Recipes

This website displays a few breakfast recipes done purely with HTML, no CSS styling. It contains a main page that links to each recipe article.

This project will allow me to:
- Understand relative paths
- Insert images from the web
- Use different header types
- Create ordered and unordered lists
